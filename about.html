      RoScript
    </h1>
    This is a WIP language developed by Team 5913 used to more easily program autonomous modes for First Tech Challenge robots. Here's what stuff does:
    <h3>
      goto
    </h3>
    Tells the robot where to move and how to position itself on the field. Example: <code>goto x: 0.3 y: 0.6 heading: 90</code>
    <h3> <!-- @Matthew I think this would be cleaner, especially to implement -->
      attachment <!-- Robot movement is fun, and it's very separate from attachment movement; trying to coordinate the two is nigh impossible -->
<!--       True, maybe they should just be separate. Especially because attachment gives direct control and goto is indirect.
 Actually, why not call it "set" instead? Well, that's not quite what it does But maybe it could do that But there's a reason it doesn't, and it's the same as why driving isn't that. Because rapidly going to a certain position is a bad idea. This could possibly work for servos, but not for motors.
We could have a set command separate as well, for setting power, but goto is an indirect method that goes to a position True, though I think of goto as a command to set robot position relative to the field and abstracts the wheels. this is more of a "set to this position" where set would then be "set to this speed"
However.
You can't set a motor to a position. And many attachments are motors
True, but the servo ones are set to a position
Then it makes more sense to make it "set", because for a motor, it would set the speed, and for a servo, it would set the position. It's the most raw control possible for those two units.
However.
The point is disconnecting the control of the drive motors from the individual attachments, since the drive motors are the only ones that should be coordinated.
The attachment command isolates to attachments, but the `set` and `goto` commands could both be used for both normal mode and attachment mode.
I know. This would only be used for attachment motors or attachment servos. The drive motors are abstracted away with goto.
...? How does goto handle an attachment? It's for positionally moving the robot.
Exactly.
So goto cannot do both
No
Because
Goto goes to a position. But a position can be in the range of a motor as well. As an example...
We had a motor one year to raise/lower the robot. It's reasonable to have that move toward the place.
I think I actually get it. So for a motor attachment o rcontinuous servo, goto would be "set to a specific position" and set/attachment would be "set to this speed". For servos I'm not sure if there's a difference.
Set/attachment would be for setting speeds of things, such as attachment motors or the speed of the robot
Again, attachment can be used for multiple things
Let's give 4 examples:
attachment claw goto pos: 0 stop
attachment railgun set power: 1 stop
goto x: 0 y: 0
set fl: 1 fr: 1 bl: 1 br: 1 // RAM WHATEVE
-->
    </h3>
    Tells an attachment to do something, specified by the rest of the command. Example: <code>attachment claw pos: 0.6</code>
